One Yard: The Story of Joey Counts' Comeback

<p>One yard. That was all that stood between the Montana Grizzlies and one of the biggest victories in their program's history. It was all that stood between Joey Counts and redemption.</p>

<p>One yard doesn't sound like much. It's the smallest unit there is on a football field, the distance between every hashmark.</p>

<p>When hundreds of them are gained and lost every game, it's sometimes easy to discount the value of a single one.</p>

<p>But when you're losing by four, losing to the number one team in the nation with six seconds left in the game, with 26,000 of your fans screaming from the stands on fourth and goal from the one-yard line, sometimes that one yard becomes everything.</p>

<p>The play call came into the Montana Grizzlies huddle. Iso. A run play, designed to go straight up the middle, power against power.</p>

<p>Joey Counts was the running back. His assignment was simple - score any way possible.</p>

<p>One play, one yard. If he got it, the Grizzlies would beat North Dakota State, four-time defending national champion. If he didn't, they would lose. Nobody would remember how close they had been.</p>

<p>Quarterback Brady Gustafson started his cadence. NDSU defenders bounced around the line of scrimmage, prowling and pointing. The ball was snapped and Counts plunged ahead...</p>

<p>There were times when Joey Counts didn't think he would make it back. Times when he would sit and wonder, after a particularly difficult rehab session, if he would ever fully recover from a foot injury that he suffered in his sophomore year of college.</p>

<p>"It was the biggest struggle. You go through some depression and you have to find your own way. You can't really describe it unless you've been there ...it's just an internal battle every day," Counts said.</p>

<p>Counts knows what tough battles are. He came to Montana only after another school pulled its scholarship offer to him in January of his senior year of high school.</p>

<p>He was deciding between walking on at Arizona State and going to community college when then-Grizzlies coach Robin Pflugrad decided he wanted to take another look at the running back from Mesa, Arizona.</p>

<p>Montana could only offer him a scholarship to cover the cost of his books, but Counts went to Missoula anyway.</p>

<p>In his first year he only carried the ball 14 times. His second year, in 2013, was better. Thanks to injuries of older, more experienced players, he got regular work over the first eight games, carrying 41 times for 207 yards.</p>

<p>But then Counts got hurt himself. It was a foot injury, which are notoriously difficult to gauge recovery time for.</p>

<p>He sat out the last five games of the 2013 season, hoping that his foot would heal naturally. But it didn't, and that offseason he had no choice but to have surgery -  and thus started the grind that would dominate an entire year of Joey Counts' life.</p>

<p>Any athlete will tell you that the rehab process coming off an injury is one of the most difficult things to go through.</p>

<p>They have to watch their teammates play the game they love without them. They have to deal with the constant everyday workouts. And they have to wonder if all that work is even getting them anywhere, if they'll ever be back to the way they once were.</p>

<p>That's what Joey Counts had to deal with.</p>

<p>"I never thought about packing it in, but I just wasn't sure," Counts said. "With not being the same, I wasn't sure what I would do at that point. Packing it in never came across my mind, but definitely wondering if I ever would get back. Some days I'd say 'oh there's no way I can get back' other days I was like 'no I can do this.'"</p>

<p>But Counts has been a competitor his whole life. He was all-state in football and wrestling at Desert Ridge High School in Mesa, where his football coach Jeremy Hathcock described him as one of the most intense players he's ever had.</p>

<p>Counts didn't even play running back for Hathcock until the middle of his junior year, when he moved from middle linebacker to the offensive backfield and took Desert Ridge all the way to the state championship game.</p>

<p>"He's a guy who'll get done with a three-hour practice and go right to the weight room and work out for another hour," Hathcock said.</p>

<p>Ryan Ramirez, one of Counts' youth coaches, taught him how to lift weights when Counts was 14, and saw how quickly the young man picked it up. Their workout sessions in Ramirez' garage in Mesa became a big part of Counts' life, leaving him with a habit that he would carry with him to Montana.</p>

<p>"He's a very disciplined kid", Ramirez said. "And I think weightlifting is perfect for someone like that because you always have goals, and Joey's been very big on setting goals for himself and reaching them. Every time I see him in the offseason he's like 'Coach, my goal is this: I'm going to do this, I'm going to finish this' and I just tell him that's great."</p>

<p>So Counts attacked his rehab the same way he would attack a workout, setting goals and grinding through them, dealing with the dark days and the early wake-up calls and the uncertainty and the fear.</p>

<p>It was a long way back, but he made it. Going into the 2015 season, Counts was fully recovered and listed on the depth chart at running back for the Grizzlies again.</p>

<p>The season opener against NDSU would mark 480 days since Counts last stepped on a football field for a competitive game, and he was ready to shake off the bad memories from every single one of them.</p>

<p>"I was excited just to be able to play again and to be back on the field with all my guys. The anticipation for that game was insane and the preparation we put in, so it was great," Counts said.</p>

<p>He couldn't have asked for a bigger stage on which to make his return. NDSU was the four-time defending national champion, and the Bison had acquired a near-mythical status at the FCS level. The game would also be shown on ESPN.</p>

<p>The Grizzlies kept it close, and forced a punt with just under two minutes left in the game, losing 35-31.</p>

<p>With Washington-Grizzly Stadium rocking, quarterback Brady Gustafson drove the Grizzlies to the one-yard line of the Bison.</p>

<p>On first and second down, Gustafson threw incomplete. On third down, Counts got the call. He tried to jump over the defensive line, but didn't want to extend the ball for fear of losing it. He was ruled just short of a touchdown.</p>

<p>That made it fourth down. Fourth and goal, with the game hanging in the balance. The Grizzlies called their last timeout. The stadium clock read six seconds. The ball rested on the one-yard line.</p>

<p>When the play call came into the huddle Counts said that he was thinking about one thing.</p>

<p>"When we were in the huddle the only thing on my mind was going into the endzone. Without a doubt I was going to get in, I just wasn't sure how."</p>

<p>He lined up behind Gustafson and two linebackers, brought onto the field to serve as lead blockers.</p>

<p>At the snap, Counts chopped his feet once quickly, to get momentum. He took the handoff and then, as soon as he did so, veered left. The NDSU defender on the edge had gone too far upfield, and Counts danced through the vacant hole.</p>

<p>"I just read it like any other play. I saw a seam out of the corner of my eye because I was running up the middle did a little jump cut to the outside and that was that," Counts said.</p>

<p>Seeing how quickly the play developed, you're reminded again of how short a distance one yard really is. One moment, Counts is taking the handoff, the next, he's burst through the line and is in the endzone.</p>

<p>Count's touchdown blew the top off of Washington-Grizzly Stadium as 26,000 Montana fans erupted.</p>

<p>As they celebrated, setting off a party that would go through the night in Missoula, Joey Counts, sitting in the locker room, took a moment to reflect on that one yard.</p>

<p>"It's just one of those things where you sit there, and you soak it all in, and it's hard to realize what just happened because everything happens so quick. Even though I was off for two years it's like everything's flooded at once, and, in that moment, it was like it all paid off."</p>
