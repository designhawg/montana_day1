# SND tablet quick course
Greetings from SND.

## About
We'll be starting each day at 9 a.m. and wrapping up at 5 p.m. You will receive an email before the class with instructions on location specific instructions.

## To do
You'll need to have a few thing preloaded onto your laptops before arriving to class to get the absolute most out of these sessions. All of these resources are open source or free to try.

### Download the class code

### Software needed

* **Google Chrome** We use google chrome in our classes so that instructors can better assist students as we work with you in the classroom. Having a single browser to use for debugging aids in this process. http://www.google.com/chrome/
* **Sublime Text 3** Much like the use of a single browser, we use a single text editor to make it easier for us to teach the course. Bonus, Sublime Text operates the same across operating systems so their isn't a big leap between Mac and Windows-based machines. http://www.sublimetext.com/
